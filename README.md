**Remark** It is strongly recommended to perform a test run using the [`-WhatIf`](#whatif) parameter if you are running the script or operation for the first time.

## Pre-requisites

### Permissions

This script requires administrator rights to be run.

### PowerShell version

This script requires [PowerShell version 5.0](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/windows-powershell/whats-new/what-s-new-in-windows-powershell-50) or later to be run.

### PowerShell Modules

This script makes use of functions from the PowerShell Tool Kit ([PSTK]) module and Alteryx PowerShell ([PSAYX]) module as described in the [dependencies section](#dependencies).

The modules must be [installed](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/powershellget/install-module) on the local machine, or placed in the `lib` folder at the root of the script directory.

## Logs

Transcript log files are generated in the log directory of the script.

- The naming convention of the transcript log file is: `<Timestamp>_<Action>-Alteryx.log`
- The format of the log is: `<Timestamp>\t<Message type>\t<Message>`

Additional log files are generated by [InstallAware](https://www.installaware.com/) during the installation, upgrade, or uninstallation of Alteryx as an XML file in the same log directory. Those are disabled by default because of the negative impact on the speed of execution, but they can be enabled by setting the configuration variable `InstallAwareLog` to `true`.

The naming convention of the InstallAware log file is: `<Timestamp>_<Setup.exe>.log`

Below is an example of a successful installation log:

```log

## Known issues

Below are listed known issues that might occur depending on your environment.

Please report any new problem using the [GitHub repository issue page](https://github.com/Akaizoku/alteryx-deploy/issues).

### Access to the cloud file is denied

This error can occur during the backup of the application when [OneDrive](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/onedrive/one-drive-sync) is installed and is synchronising the temporary backup files while the script attempts to remove them (see [PowerShell issue #9246](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/9246) for more information).

This has no impact on the backup process and only affects temporary files used to generate the backup archive.

> 2021-11-21 02:12:55     INFO    Remove staging backup folder
> 2021-11-21 02:12:55     ERROR   Access to the cloud file is denied

It can be prevented by configuring a temporary directory (`TempDirectory`) that is not synchronised by OneDrive. Temporary files can also be removed manually.

### Transcript is not stopped

It appears that in some environments, the transcript it not stopped as expected when exiting the script.

If this occurs, simply run the command [`Stop-Transcript`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/Microsoft.PowerShell.Host/Stop-Transcript) or [`Stop-AllTranscripts`](https://github.com/Akaizoku/PSTK/blob/main/Public/Stop-AllTranscripts.ps1).
